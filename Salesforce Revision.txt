Lets talk about CRMs, we know that their are so many CRMs existing in the market then why is that Salesforce.com is the world's no 1 CRM.
The answer is Cloud Computing. It is a ON DEMAND CRM.
Cloud Computing seperates the applicating from its hardware and software dependencies. Cloud Computing vendors take care of backend hardware and software dependencies.
Enterprise are moving to the cloud - 
Mainframe >> Mini >> Client/Server >> Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing - 
Network based computing >> Network means Internet >> Computing referes to Development and Services >> So, Internet based development and services. >> Shared resources >> ONCLOUD and ON DEMAND
ON DEMAND - means you pay for what you use.

Models of Cloud Computing - 
SaaS - Software as a Service - Salesforce, Netsuite, Taleo, Zoho, Zimbra
PaaS - Platform as a Service - Google app Engine, Force.com, Azure

No upfront licence fees, lower implementation costs, no hardware infrastructure, free upgrades etc..

Section 2 - 
In this section we will understand the sales lifecycle. Then we will be analysing our functional requriement (case study).
Sales LifeCycle - If required pen it down afterwards.
1) Standard Salesforce Applications and Custom Salesforce Applications
A functional Requirement - 
Star Pharma Ltd. manufactures and sells five different pharmaceutical products - Pedialyte, Similac, Ultrazyme, Ketonex and Flexiflo. They target pharmacies in multi speciality hospitals to sell their priducts. The field reps (FR) call and go to many hospitals to talk to the physicians about their products. The Field Sales Manager (FSM) needs to track the effort of this team and determine which all products are selling.
To help and support the sales effort, the fields reps carry product samples that they distribute to physicians showing interest. These samples are at a cost to the company so FSM needs to track how many samples they are giving out.
Ultimately, FSM needs to know what his reps are doing, which samples they are giving out, and how they are building the customer base. He also needs details of the following - 
1) Track number of visits.
2) Couple of reports arounf # of visits, products sold etc...
3) Whenever a final state of product is done, an automated email needs to be sent to their supervisor.

As part of promotional offers , Star Pharma gives out 20% discount on all purchases above 1000$ but upon approval by the supervisor.

Step1 - List down the various objects and their corresponding fields that you think should be a part of StarPharma app - 
Setup >> Create >> App
Setup >> Create >> Object(Pharma Products)
Setup >> Search >> Tabs >> Select Pharma Product from Dropdown 

Object Relationships in Salesforce - 
1:M - Master-Detail and Lookup
	1 parent record is related to multiple child object records

Master Detail 							Lookup
Child records should be associated to a parent			Optional. Child records need not be associated to a parent
Cascade record deletion						No cascase record deletion
Standard objects cannot be a detail object (child object)	No such restrictions
Master detail relationship field is required on the 		
page layout of the details object.				Lookup field on child not necessarily required
Rollup summary fields can be created on the parent object.	Cannot be established here.
Detail object inherits the sharing and security settings of
its master record.						No effect on security.

M:M - 2 record of parent is related to multiple records of child object and vice versa.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before starting with salesforce app development lets go through several salesforce terminologies - 
App - Collection of components
Object (table) - particular type of information
Fields (columns) - attributes of an object
Records (rows) - holds information
Tabs - UI component to display object data

Standard Components and Custom Components - 
Standard (Available in Salesforce)
Custom (Created by us)
Standard Component				Custom Component
Available in Salesforce				Created by us
Cannot be created				Can be created
Can be viewed					Can be viewed
Can be modified but to a certain extent		Can be modified to any extent
Cannot be deleted				Can be deleted

Master Detail means parent object must exist in order to create a child object.

1:M - 
	The relationship field gets created in the child object.
	The related list gets created in the parent object.
M:M - (Pharma Product : Invoice)
	This can be achieved by creating 2 Master Detail relationships.
	M-D1
		Parent - Pharma Product
		Child - Junction Object
	M-D2
		Parent - Invoice
		Child - Junction Object

Schema Builder - A dynamic environment for viewing and modifying all the objects and relationships in your app.
